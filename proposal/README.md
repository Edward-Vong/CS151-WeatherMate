# WeatherMate
Team members working on the proposal:
- Dylan Weitz
- Jonathan Luc
- Edward Vong

Problem Statement:
- Currently, there are few weather apps that do not employ mal-business practices such as predatory and misinformative advertisements to provide information to users on the web. 

What is currently on market (References):
- Weather.com

Assumptions:
- The API that we are using will have the weather data for all locations that the user can input, and that the information is accurate. 

Operating Environment:
- We can use a graphical user interface like javafx, and we can also deploy the program onto a webpage that can be publicly accessed. 

Intended Usage:
- To find data on present and future weather conditions. 

Plan/Approach to Resolve Issue:
- We will design a weather application that would allow users to look at the weather forecast of their specified (if able, current) location without the utilization of advertisements and misinformation. 

Functionality:
- The application will pull information from an API to be processed and displayed.
- Utilizes JavaFX to employ GUI for user interaction with the application
- Most Information will be processed directly through Java with some supplemental help from other languages/resources if required.
  - ie. Utilize MERN stack if developing a web application. 

Operations: 
- Selecting the location of the weather that will be displayed
- Selecting the type of weather information is desired.
